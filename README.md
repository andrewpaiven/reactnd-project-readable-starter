# Readable 

This application is the final react/redux project of udacity's react nanodegree.

Readable is a forum-like application where users can add, comment and vote on posts. It's entirely built with react using redux for state management. No CSS templates were harmed during the development process of this application.

## Launching the application

To get started with the application you will need to start the API server and the user interface

* Install and start the API server
    - `cd api-server`
    - `npm install`
    - `node server`
* For the user interface
	- `cd ui-client`
    - `npm install`
    - `npm start`

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](api-server/README.md).
